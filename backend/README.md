- **Node.js** (v18 or above) and **npm**
- **pnpm** (preferred package manager)

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the backend repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stakepoint/starkwager-backend.git
cd backend
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` provided. Update the empty fields:


### 4. Run the Project

The project supports running in development or production mode via Docker.

#### Development Mode

Use the following command to start the development environment:

```bash
pnpm docker:dev
```

This command will build and start the development containers using the `docker-compose.dev.yml` configuration file.

#### Production Mode

To run the project in production mode:

```bash
pnpm docker:prod
```

This will use the `docker-compose.prod.yml` configuration file to build and start the production containers.

#### Stopping Containers

To stop and remove containers, use:

- For development:

```bash
pnpm docker:down:dev
```

- For production:

```bash
pnpm docker:down:prod
```

- To stop all environments:

```bash
pnpm docker:down:all
```
